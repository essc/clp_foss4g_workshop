==============================
The :index:`QGIS Interface`
==============================

QGIS provides an easy to use :term:`Graphical user interface (GUI)` to explore, 
create and edit geospatial data. Commands and functions are activated using a 
combination of menu, toolbar and keyboard shortcut actions within the application.

This exercise will explore the basic interface of QGIS. You will create your 
first QGIS project, load various data layers, customize the appearance of your 
map using various data symbology and colors.

We will use the provided Quiapo dataset.

**Interface Overview**

* **1. Map Legend/Layers** - where you add layers and interact with them, such 
  as grouping them, setting symbology, and such.
* **2. Map View** - the main map area where the layers show up and all your 
  visualization is done.
* **3. Tool Bar** - button bars. Like most modern windows applications you can 
  drag your button bars around and move them between layers. Hover over each 
  button and you will get a short description of what it is for.
* **4. Menu Bar** - most of the functionality in the Toolbar are up here as 
  well.  Donâ€™t forget the all-important :guilabel:`Help` . QGIS has good 
  documentation so use it.
* **5. Status Bar** - shows status, coordinates and scale of the Map View. 
  Sometimes map display updates also called rendering can be slow when using 
  large data files.  You can turn off rendering when dealing with large files 
  until you want to see the layers. 

:index:`Creating a new project`
----------------------------------

1. Launch QGIS by clicking :guilabel:`Start -->` :guilabel:`All Programs -->` 
:guilabel:`Quantum GIS -->` 
:guilabel:`Quantum GIS` .

2. Create a new project. :menuselection:`File -->` |mActionFileNew| 
:guilabel:`New Project`.

A QGIS session is considered a Project. QGIS works on one project at a time. 
Settings are considered as being per-project or as a default for new projects.  
The kinds of information saved in a project file include:

* Layers added;
* Layer properties, including symbolization;
* Projection for the map view and;
* Last viewed extent.

.. warning:: 
   The project file is saved in XML format (with a ``.qgs`` file extension), 
   it is possible to edit the file outside QGIS if you **know what you are 
   doing**.

3. Open the project properties. In the Menu, select 
:menuselection:`Settings -->` :guilabel:`Project Properties`.

.. image:: images/project_properties.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300 pt

* In the :guilabel:`General` tab you can define the project title, selection and 
  background color, layer units, precision, and the option to save relative paths 
  to layers.
* The :guilabel:`Coordinate Reference System (CRS)` tab enables you to choose the 
  CRS for this project, and to enable on-the-fly re-projection of layers when 
  displaying layers from a different CRS. 
* The :guilabel:`Identifiable Layers` tab you set (or disable) which layers will 
  respond to the :guilabel:`Identify` tool. 

4. Select the :guilabel:`Coordinate Reference System (CRS)` tab. Click the small 
:guilabel:`triangle` on the left side of the 
:guilabel:`Geographic Coordinate System`. This shows another list of CRS. Choose 
:guilabel:`WGS 84`. Click :guilabel:`Apply` then, :guilabel:`OK`.

.. note::
   There is no need to set the CRS of the project if the layers to be loaded are 
   of the same projection because QGIS will draw the coordinates using the data source. 
   However, the :guilabel:`On The Fly transformations` needs to be enabled and the 
   projection to be followed selected if the layers are of different projections.

.. image:: images/set_crs.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300 pt

.. tip::
   Many GIS application opens any geospatial data (vector or raster) without 
   asking for the coordinate referencing systems. QGIS follows a similar 
   behavior. However, it is good practice to select the correct CRS whenever you 
   start a new project. This habit can help you with problems in the future. 


:index:`Opening Vector data`
-------------------------------
1. Add vector layers. In the Menu, select :menuselection:`Layer -->` 
|mActionAddOgrLayer| :guilabel:`Add Vector Layer`.

.. image:: images/add_vector_layer.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300 pt

In the :guilabel:`Source type`, choose :guilabel:`File`. Click :guilabel:`Browse` 
and double-click to your extracted data directory.

Select multiple vector layers by holding the :kbd:`Ctrl` button of your 
keyboard while selecting files. Select the following files::

      admin_bnd.shp
      buildings.shp
      ecclesiastical_bnd.shp
      pois.shp
      roads.shp

.. image:: images/add_vector_layer_select.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300 pt

Once all the files are selected, Click :guilabel:`Open`. All vector layers will 
be loaded within your :guilabel:`Map View` area.

.. image:: images/loaded_layers.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300 pt

:term:`Vector` data are represented as either point, line or polygon. The type of 
vector depends on what information you wish to convey.

* Points - represented by a single X,Y coordinate. A point normally represents a 
  geographic feature that is too small to be displayed as a line or area.  For 
  example, oil wells and fire hydrants.
* Lines - A set of ordered coordinates that represent the shape of geographic 
  features too narrow to be displayed as an area at the given scale or linear 
  features with no area (county boundary lines). For example, railways, roads, 
  rivers.
* Polygons - A feature used to represent areas. A polygon is defined by the lines 
  that make up its boundary and a point inside its boundary for identification. 
  Polygons have attributes that describe the geographic feature they represent. 
  For example, forest stands, lakes. 

2. Arrange the display order of layers by selecting a layer in the 
:guilabel:`Map Legend` and then drag to either above or below the other layers.

.. image:: images/drag_layers.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300 pt

Arrange the data according to this list from top to bottom::

      pois.shp
      roads.shp
      buildings.shp
      ecclesiastical_bnd.shp
      admin_bnd.shp

.. tip::
    Mapping standards suggest that points layers should be on top followed by 
    lines and finally polygons.

:index:`Changing the look of your data layer`
-----------------------------------------------
1. Changing vector layer properties like color and symbolization. Select the 
``admin_bnd`` layer and right-click on the layer and select 
:guilabel:`Properties` from the pop-up menu.

.. image:: images/select_vector_properties.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300 pt

The :guilabel:`Layer Properties` dialog for a vector layer provides information 
about the layer, symbology settings and labeling options. This dialog box allows 
you to customize the overall look of your vector data layers.

.. image:: images/vector_layer_properties.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300 pt

2. Select the :guilabel:`Style` tab. This provides you several ways to control 
how vector features are displayed.  For this layer, we will change the fill 
color.  In the :guilabel:`Legend type`, select :guilabel:`Single Symbol`.

.. image:: images/select_symbol_color.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300 pt

3. In the :guilabel:`Fill options`, click on the :guilabel:`Fill options color`.  
Another window showing the :guilabel:`Select Color` will then appear. Set the Red,
Green, Blue (R:G:B) values to `253:246:229` respectively and click :guilabel:`OK`.

.. image:: images/select_color.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300 pt

4. Select the :guilabel:`General` tab. This provides ways to change the display 
name, set scale dependent rendering options, create a spatial index of the vector 
file and view or change the projection of the specific vector layer.  Change 
the :guilabel:`Display name` to ``Administrative boundaries``.

.. image:: images/general_tab.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300 pt

5. Click :guilabel:`Create Spatial Index`. A spatial index will improve the speed 
of both zooming and panning. Spatial index used by QGIS have a ``.qix`` extension.
Click :guilabel:`Apply` --> :guilabel:`OK`.

6. Repeat all the steps above to change layer properties of each vector.  Follow 
the table below:

+------------------------+---------------------------+--------------+------------------+---------------------+-----------------+
| Layer 	         |Display Name               | Legend Type  |Icon              |Outline Options (RGB)|Fill Options(RGB)|
+========================+===========================+==============+==================+=====================+=================+
| pois                   | POIs                      | Single Symbol|small black circle|n/a                  |n/a              |
+------------------------+---------------------------+--------------+------------------+---------------------+-----------------+
| roads                  | Roads                     | Single Symbol|n/a               |150:150:150          |None             |
+------------------------+---------------------------+--------------+------------------+---------------------+-----------------+
| buildings              | Buildings                 | Single Symbol|n/a               |111:111:111          |215:194:209      |
+------------------------+---------------------------+--------------+------------------+---------------------+-----------------+
| ecclesiastical_bnd     | Ecclesiastical boundaries | Single Symbol|n/a               |50:50:50             |None             |
+------------------------+---------------------------+--------------+------------------+---------------------+-----------------+

7. Explore the other options of the vector properties. The 
:guilabel:`Layer Properties` provides several options to customize the look and 
feel of your layers. Use the other options until you're satisfied with the look.  
Try the following:

* Legend types
* Outline/Line options
* Fill options
* Different markers for points
* Transparency 

:index:`Navigating around your map`
--------------------------------------
Basic tools for navigating around the :guilabel:`Map View` involve the use of the 
zoom and pan functions. Each tool is explained below:

* |mActionPan| :guilabel:`Pan` - Interactively move the center of the map
* |mActionZoomIn| :guilabel:`Zoom In` - Zoom in
* |mActionZoomOut| :guilabel:`Zoom Out` - Zoom out
* |mActionZoomFullExtent| :guilabel:`Zoom Full` - Zooms to the full view of of 
  all the layers
* |mActionZoomToLayer| :guilabel:`Zoom to Layer` - Zoom to the active or selected 
  vector
* |mActionZoomToSelected| :guilabel:`Zoom to Selection` - Zoom to the selected 
  object within a vector layer
* |mActionZoomLast| :guilabel:`Zoom Last` and :guilabel:`Zoom Next` - Goes back 
  and forth to the previous zoom
* |mActionDraw| :guilabel:`Refresh` - Redraw all data layers

**Zooming and panning with the mouse wheel.** You can also press the mouse wheel 
to pan inside of the main window and you can roll the mouse wheel to zoom in and 
out on the map. For zooming, place the mouse cursor inside the map area and roll 
it forward (away from you) to zoom in and backwards (towards you) to zoom out. 
The mouse cursor position will be the center of the zoomed area of interest.

**Zooming and panning with the keyboard.** Place the mouse cursor inside the map 
area and click on the right arrow key to pan east, left arrow key to pan west, up 
arrow key to pan north and down arrow key to pan south. The :kbd:`PgUp` and 
:kbd:`PgDown` keys on your keyboard will cause the map display to zoom in or out.

.. tip::
   While you can do most navigation using the mouse, using the arrow keys on the 
   keyboard for map navigation is very useful in many cases especially during 
   digitizing.

Use the navigation tools to move in and around your map.

Saving your first project
--------------------------
1. In the :menuselection:`File` menu, select |mActionFileSave| 
:guilabel:`Save Project`. In the :guilabel:`Filename` field, type::

     myfirstqgisproject.qgs

2. Click :guilabel:`Save`. 
You have saved your first QGIS project.

Other tips
-----------
1. :index:`Map 
Overview` 
  

The map overview panel provides a full extent view of layers added to it. Within 
this panel is a red box showing the current :guilabel:`Map View` extent. This 
allows you to quickly determine which area of the map you are currently viewing.

To activate the :guilabel:`Map Overview`, in the Menu, select 
:menuselection:`View -->` :guilabel:`Panels -->` 
:guilabel:`Overview`. A new 
panel will be added below the :guilabel:`Map Legend` (no map is displayed at the 
moment).

.. image:: images/panels_overview.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300 pt

We will add the ``Ecclesiastical boundaries`` layer in the overview map. Select 
the ``Ecclesiastical boundaries`` layer, then right-click and select 
:guilabel:`Show in Overview`.

The ``Ecclesiastical boundaries`` layer should appear in the :guilabel:`Overview` 
panel.

.. image:: images/overview_panel.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300 pt

You can also add more layers or remove them. If you click and drag the red 
rectangle in the overview that shows your current extent, the main 
:guilabel:`Map View` will update accordingly.

.. warning::
   Do not add too many layers into the :guilabel:`Overview` panel, this can slow 
   down rendering of the overview map.

2. :index:`Line and Area 
Measurements`  

To interactively measure length and area, use the:

* |mActionMeasure| :guilabel:`Measure Line`
* |mActionMeasureArea| :guilabel:`Measure Area` 

The tool then allows you to click points on the map. Each segment-length as well 
as the total shows up in the measure-window. To stop measuring click your right 
mouse button. Areas can also be measured. The accumulated area-size will be 
visible in the measure window.

.. warning::
   Length and area results inherit the default projection and ellipsoid units! 
   If you are using the Decimal Degrees (which is the case in our current project)
   as the layer units, the length and area results will be in decimal degrees as 
   well.

3. :index:`Using the 
Labeling Tool`  


The Labeling tool provides smart labeling for vector point, line and polygon 
layers and only requires a few parameters.

Select the ``Roads`` layer.

Open the labeling plug-in, in the Menu, select 
:menuselection:`Layer -->` 
:guilabel:`Labeling`.

.. image:: images/smart_label_plugin.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300 pt

A new window will appear for the :guilabel:`Layer labeling settings`. Mark the 
following options shown in the screenshots below:

.. image:: images/smart_label_properties.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300 pt


.. image:: images/smart_label_properties1.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300 pt


Select :guilabel:`OK`. The label for ``Roads`` should be placed above the road 
line. As you pan around the map, you'll find that labels are placed nicely.

.. image:: images/smart_label_roads.png

   :width: 300 pt

4. Importing 
Image  
 

To import the :guilabel:`Map View` into an image, in the Menu, select 
:menuselection:`File -->` :guilabel:`Save as image`.

Select your preferred filename and image type. Click :guilabel:`Save`. You now 
have you first map image which you can add in any document or report.

.. image:: images/import_image.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300 pt

5. Save your project. To save your project, select 
:menuselection:`File -->` 
:guilabel:`Save Project`.

.. tip::
   It is good practice to save your project after every major editing activity. 
   Make sure you save your project frequently. Or better, practice the keyboard 
   shortcut to save projects: :kbd:`Ctrl + S`.
