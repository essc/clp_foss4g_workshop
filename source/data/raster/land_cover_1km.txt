Title		UMD Land Cover Classification for Cebu

Abstract	The University of Maryland Department of 
                Geography generated this global land cover 
                classification collection in 1998. Imagery 
                from the AVHRR satellites acquired between 
                1981 and 1994 were analyzed to distinguish 
                fourteen land cover classes. This product 
                is available at three spatial scales: 1 
                degree, 8 kilometer and 1 kilometer pixel 
                resolutions. 
                
                Original data was clipped to within Cebu bounds
                and converted to ESRI ASCII Grid.
