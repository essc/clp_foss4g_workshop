About ESSC 
----------
The **Environmental Science for Social Change** (ESSC) is a Jesuit research 
institute with a 20-year history of engagement in local, national and regional 
research and dialogue that contribute to an understanding and sustainability of 
community-based environmental management through the development of a 
"science for social change".

ESSC's approach to environmental mapping makes significant contribution to 
building people's capacities to collectively manage and plan towards an 
improvement of their way of life through a more responsive management of the 
environment.

About Quiapo Church 
-----------------------

**Quiapo Church**, after the experiences of Typhoons Ondoy, Pepeng, and Sendong, 
realized that there is a lack of facility to gather speedy information at the 
CBCP-NASSA level that will ensure an efficient disaster response. Moreover, 
Quiapo Church also recognizes the need for a resource center for disaster 
risk reduction with three components: scientific, information and technology, 
and parish training and mobilization.

Quiapo Church set up a disaster management office (Disaster Management Ministry 
or DMM) to provide the systems and technology available to understand the 
vulnerabilities in various dioceses in the Philippines and gather speedy information 
during disasters.

collaborative effort to enable a broader parish and diocese awareness,

risk reduction in the country.
