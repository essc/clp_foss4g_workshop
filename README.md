Style Guide 
=================

Our documentation is generated from reStructured text
sources using Sphinx. reSt is similar to wiki markup, and readable in
plain ascii.

The style generally follows the python documentation style guide: 
http://docs.python.org/devguide/documenting.html

Conventions
======================

This section describes a collection of uniform styles throughout the manual.

GUI Conventions
-----------------------

The GUI convention styles are intended to mimic the appearance of the GUI. In 
general, the objective is to use the non-hover appearance, so a user can 
visually scan the GUI to find something that looks like the instruction in 
the manual.

* Images

``    .. |mActionAddRasterLayer| image:: images/qgis_icons/mActionAddRasterLayer.png
                               :align: center
                               :width: 20 px``
    
    
*  Menu Options: ``:menuselection:`Layer --> Add a Raster Layer` `` or 
   ``:menuselection:`Settings --> Toolbars --> Digitizing` ``
*  Tool: ``|mActionAddRasterLayer| :guilabel:`Add a Raster Layer` ``
*  Button: ``:guilabel:`Save as Default` ``
*  Dialog Box Title: ``:guilabel:`Layer Properties` ``
*  Tab: ``|tab|``
*  Checkbox: ``|checkbox| Render``
*  Radio Button:  ``|radiobuttonon| Postgis SRID |radiobuttonoff| EPSG ID``
*  Select a Number: ``|selectnumber|``
*  Select a String: ``|selectstring|``
*  Browse for a File: ``|browsebutton|``
*  Select a Color: ``|selectcolor|``
*  Slider: ``|slider|``
*  Input Text: ``|inputtext|``

Text or Keyboard Conventions
-------------------------------

The manual also includes styles related to text, keyboard commands and coding 
to indicate different entities, such as classes, or methods. They don't 
correspond to any actual appearance.

.. Use for all urls. Otherwise, it is not clickable in the document.

*  Hyperlinks: http://qgis.org
*  Keystroke Combinations: press :kbd:`Ctrl+B`, meaning press and hold the Ctrl key and then press the B key.
*  Name of a File: :file:`lakes.shp`
*  Name of a Class: **NewLayer**
*  Method: *classFactory*
*  Server: *myhost.de*
*  User Text: ``qgis ---help``
*  A comment not rendered in the final output: .. some text

Code is indicated by a fixed-width font::
     
     PROJCS["NAD_1927_Albers",
       GEOGCS["GCS_North_American_1927",


Sentence case is a set of capitalization rules used in English sentences: 
the first word is always capitalized and other words are only capitalized if 
there is a specific rule requiring it.

 
Platform-specific instructions
---------------------------------------

GUI sequences and small amounts of text can be formatted inline: Click 
|nix| |win| :menuselection:`File` |osx| :menuselection:`QGIS  --> Quit to close 
QGIS`.

This indicates that on Linux, Unix and Windows platforms, click the File menu 
option first, then Quit from the dropdown menu, while on Macintosh OSX platforms,
click the |qg| menu option first, then Quit from the dropdown menu. Larger 
amounts of text may be formatted as a list:

*  |nix| do this;
*  |win| do that;
*  |osx| do something else.

or as paragraphs.

|nix| |osx| Do this and this and this. Then do this and this and this and this 
and this and this and this and this and this.

|win| Do that. Then do that and that and that and that and that and that and 
that and that and that and that and that and that and that and that and that.

Screenshots that appear throughout the user guide have been created on different 
platforms; the platform is indicated by the platform-specific iconsat the end of 
the figure caption.
